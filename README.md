# Skill-Based Job Role Predictor

Skill-Based Job Role Predictor
About the Project
This project predicts job roles based on a set of user-inputted skills. The model was trained using a Random Forest algorithm to classify the most suitable job titles from a given skillset. It is trained using a dataset of job listings and skill profiles, and it demonstrates strong accuracy in predicting career roles based on a personâ€™s qualifications.

How It Works
The Skill-Based Job Role Predictor uses supervised machine learning to classify job titles based on skills provided by the user. The workflow involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming job listings data.

Feature Engineering: Extracting features like skills and job descriptions using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Training a Random Forest model to classify job roles based on input skills.

Prediction: Predicting the most suitable job role based on user skills.

Try It Now
You can interact with the model and predict the most suitable job role based on your skills by entering your skills (comma-separated) in the input box and clicking "Predict Job Role".

Example skills: Python, Java, SQL, Machine Learning

Model Insights
The model uses various features (skills) to predict job roles. The most important features are visualized below, which show how much impact each feature (skill) has on the model's decision-making process.

Key Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset. Below is the confusion matrix that illustrates the model's performance across different job categories:
